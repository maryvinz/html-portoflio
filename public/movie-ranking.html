<h1>The Best Movies According to Mary</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Minion Movie</h3>
<p>Silly and cute. Gave lots of laughs</p>
<h3>The Bee Movie</h3>
<p>A classic. Child friendly with adult humor and gets funnier as you get older. Good lessons to learn.</p>
<h3> Puss in Boots</h3>
<p>So good I watched it twice. Lots of adventure. There's a lot of valuable lessons to learn throughout the movie and almost made me cry at one point</p>
